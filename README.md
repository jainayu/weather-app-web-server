# web-server
Node.js is commonly used as a web server to serve up websites, JSON, and more. This project is my first Node server with **Express**. This allow users to interact with my application by visiting a URL in the browser.
In this I am simply listening on `http://localhost:3000/`, our web application to fetch the weather will show up.
