# web-server
Node.js is commonly used as a web server to serve up websites, JSON, and more. This project is my first Node server with **Express**. This allow users to interact with my application by visiting a URL in the browser.

I have deployed this web application on *Heroku* you can check that on [Weather-App](https://jainayu-weather-app.herokuapp.com/).

For those who are runing on a local machine can simply listen on `http://localhost:3000/`, this web application to fetch the weather will show up.
